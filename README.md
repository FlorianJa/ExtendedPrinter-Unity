# ExtendedPrinter-Unity

ExtendedPrinter (aka PrintARface) is an AR application for the Hololens for learning more about 3d printing and to control a real 3d printer. This application is a prototype for new AR human machine interfaces.


The application is still under development. It is currently being developed for the Lulzbot TAZ6. Support for more printers is planned.

## How does the application looks like?  
Have look at this video. It is showing the basic functionality:
